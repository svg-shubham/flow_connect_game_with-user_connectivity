🚀 ConnectDots: A High-Performance Topological Puzzle EngineA sophisticated grid-based logic game featuring real-time path validation, state-driven UI interactions, and a robust Django-integrated analytical backend.🛠️ Technical StackFrontend: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3 (Glassmorphism UI), HTML5 Canvas-like Grid.Backend: Django (Python), PostgreSQL/SQLite.Communication: Asynchronous Fetch API with CSRF Token Security.🧠 Core Engineering Challenges1. The Adjacency Logic (Mathematical Validation)To ensure the player only moves to neighboring cells, I implemented a validation algorithm based on Manhattan Distance. Instead of heavy loops, the engine parses cell coordinates and validates the move in $O(1)$ constant time.$$|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2| = 1$$2. State-Driven Drawing MachineI engineered a custom state machine to handle complex mouse interactions:Drawing State: Tracks isDrawing and lastHoveredId to prevent path breaking.Collision Detection: Automatically clears overlapping paths of different colors to maintain data integrity.3. Dual-Constraint Win ConditionThe game doesn't just check if dots are connected. It validates two distinct data states:Saturation Check: $100\%$ of the grid cells must be occupied.Topological Check: Total completed paths must equal the backend-defined color count.📊 Analytical Tracking & PerformanceThis project focuses heavily on Player Analytics. Every level completion triggers a data-sync that captures:Time Efficiency: Calculating Levels Completed / Time Taken.Move Optimization: Tracking the deviation between player moves and the minimum required path.Data Security: All game metrics are transmitted via JSON-encoded POST requests, secured with Django’s CSRF middleware.📁 Project ArchitecturePlaintext├── core_logic/
